## TODO List
* ~~Folk `hl-param` to my repo, `hl-anything`.~~
* ~~Merge `hl-symb` into `hl-anything`.~~
* ~~Write `history.el` to support generic history design.~~
* Refer to `helm-projectile` to implement project management and workspace concept.
* Design a multiple help window framework in `oops-win-mode.el`.
* Create a multiple help buffer framework in `oops-help-buffer.el`.
* Use `helm` to implement multiple help mechanism.
* Try to use hook mechanism to make strategy pattern (refer `to company`).
* Is this feature a mode or a framework? Maybe use `(oops-framework 1)` is better.
* Add copyright.
* Enhance `hl-anything`, make it flexibly support more languages.

## Usage
Add following script in your .emacs file.
```
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/oops")
(require 'oops-mode)

;; Init all the features of `oops-mode'
(oops-mode 1)
```

## TODO List
* Merge `hl-param` and `hl-symb` into it.
* Design a multiple help window framework in ``oops-win-mode.el``.
* Create a multiple help buffer framework in ``oops-help-buffer.el``.
* Try to use hook mechanism to make strategy pattern (refer `to company`).
* Is this feature a mode or a framework? Maybe use `(oops-framework 1)` is better.

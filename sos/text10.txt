25 FilesThis chapter describes the Emacs Lisp functions and variables to fi nd, create, view, save,and otherwise work with fi les and fi le directories. A few other fi le-related functionsaredescribed in Chapter 27 [Buff ers], page 521 , and those related to backups and auto-savingare described in Chapter 26 [Backups and Auto-Saving], page 511.Many of the fi le functions take one or more arguments that are fi le names. A fi le nameis actually a string. Most of these functions expand fi le name arguments by calling expand-file-name, so that ~ is handled correctly, as are relative fi le names (including‘ ../’). SeeSection 25.8.4 [File Name Expansion], page 494.In addition, certain magic fi le names are handled specially. For example, when a remotefi le name is specifi ed, Emacs accesses the fi le over the network via an appropriate protocol(see Section “Remote Files” in The GNU Emacs Manual). This handling is done at avery low level, so you may assume that all the functions described in this chapter acceptmagic fi le names as fi le name arguments, except where noted. See Section 25.11 [Magic FileNames], page 501, for details.When fi le I/O functions signal Lisp errors, they usually use the condition file-error(see Section 10.5.3.3 [Handling Errors], page 134). The error message is in most cases ob-tained from the operating system, according to locale system-messages-locale, and de-coded using coding system locale-coding-system (see Section 33.11 [Locales], page 730).

25.4 Writing to FilesYou can write the contents of a buff er, or part of a buff er, directly to a fi le on disk usingthe append-to-file and write-region functions. Don’t use these functions to write tofi les that are being visited; that could cause confusion in the mechanisms for visiting.[Command] append-to-file start end fi lenameThis function appends the contents of the region delimited by start and end in thecurrent buff er to the end of file fi lename . If that fi le does not exist, it is created. Thisfunction returns nil.An error is signaled if fi lename specifi es a nonwritable fi le, or a nonexistent fi leinadirectory where fi les cannot be created.When called from Lisp, this function is completely equivalent to:(write-region start end filename t)

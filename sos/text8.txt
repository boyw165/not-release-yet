[Command] find-file fi lename &optional wildcardsThis command selects a buff er visiting the file fi lename , using an existing buff er ifthere is one, and otherwise creating a new buff er and reading the fi le into it. It alsoreturns that buff er.Aside from some technical details, the body of the find-file function is basicallyequivalent to:(switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect filename nil nil wildcards))(See switch-to-buffer in Section 28.11 [Switching Buff ers], page 560 .)If wildcards is non-nil, which is always true in an interactive call, then find-fileexpands wildcard characters in fi lename and visits all the matching fi les.When find-file is called interactively, it prompts for fi lename in the minibuff er.

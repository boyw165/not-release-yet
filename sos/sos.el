  "The list of back-ends for the purpose of collecting candidates. The sos 
engine will dispatch all the back-ends and pass specific commands in order. 
Every command has its purpose, paremeter rule and return rule (get meaningful 
symbol name around the point, find candidates refer to a symbol name). By 
passing command and get return data from a back-end, the sos engine gets 
information to show the result to another window, minibuffer or popup a GUI 
dialog, etc. Be aware, not every back-ends will be dispatched. If a back-end 
return candidates to sos engine, it inform the sos engine that there's no need 
to dispatch remaining back-ends.

### The sample of a back-end:

  (defun some-backend (command &optional arg &rest ign)
    (case command
      (:init t)
      (:symbol (and (member major-mode MAJOR_MODE_CANDIDATES)
                    (thing-at-point 'symbol))))
      (:candidates (list STRING01 STRING02 STRING03 ...))
      (:tips TIPS)
      (:no-cache t))

Each back-end is a function that takes a variable number of arguments. The
first argument is the command requested from the sos enine.  It is one of
the following:

### The order of the commands to be called by sos engine, begins from top to down:

`:init': Called once for each buffer. The back-end can check for external
programs and files and load any required libraries.  Raising an error here
will show up in message log once, and the back-end will not be used for
completion.

`:symbol': The back-end should return a string, nil or 'stop.
Return a string which represents a symbol name tells sos engine that the back
-end will take charge current task. The back-end collect the string around the
point and produce a meaningful symbol name. It also tells sos engine don't
iterate the following back-ends.
Return nil tells sos engine to skip the back-end.
Return 'stop tells sos engine to stop iterating the following back-ends.

`:candidates': The back-end should return a CANDIDATES list or nil.
Return a list tells sos engine where the definition is and it must be a list
even if there's only one candidate. It also tells sos engine don't iterate the
following back-ends.
Return nil tells sos engine it cannot find any definition and stop iterating
the following back-ends.

 CANDIDATES format:
 ()

sample:
  TODO: sample

### Optional commands (no sequent order):

`:tips': The back-end should return a string or nil. The return string represents 
a documentation for a completion candidate. The second argument is a candidate. 
The sos engine will iterate the candidates and ask for each candidate its `tips'.

`:no-cache': Usually sos engine doesn't ask for candidates again as referencing
progresses, unless the back-end returns t for this command.  The second argument 
is the latest `symbol'."

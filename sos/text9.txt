25.1 Visiting FilesVisiting a fi le means reading a fi le into a buff er. Once this is done, we say that the bufferis visiting that fi le, and call the fi le “the visited fi le” of the buffer.A fi le and a buff er are two diff erent things. A fi le is information recorded permanentlyin the computer (unless you delete it). A buff er, on the other hand, is information insideof Emacs that will vanish at the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buff er).Usually, a buff er contains information that you have copied from a fi le; then we say the bufferis visiting that fi le. The copy in the buff er is what you modify with editing commands. Suchchanges to the buff er do not change the fi le; therefore, to make the changes permanent, youmust save the buff er, which means copying the altered buff er contents back into the file.In spite of the distinction between fi les and buff ers, people often refer to a fi le whenthey mean a buff er and vice-versa. Indeed, we say, “I am editing a fi le”, rather than, “Iamediting a buff er that I will soon save as a fi le of the same name”. Humans do not usuallyneed to make the distinction explicit. When dealing with a computer program, however, itis good to keep the distinction in mind.

[Function] find-file-noselect fi lename &optional nowarn rawfi le wildcardsThis function is the guts of all the fi le-visiting functions. It returns a buff er visitingthe fi le fi lename . You may make the buff er current or display it in a window if youwish, but this function does not do so.The function returns an existing buff er if there is one; otherwise it creates a new bufferand reads the fi le into it. When find-file-noselect uses an existing buff er, it fi rstverifi es that the fi le has not changed since it was last visited or saved in that buffer.If the fi le has changed, this function asks the user whether to reread the changed fi le.If the user says ‘yes’, any edits previously made in the buff er are lost.Reading the fi le involves decoding the fi le’s contents (see Section 33.9 [CodingSystems], page 716), including end-of-line conversion, and format conversion (seeSection 25.12 [Format Conversion], page 506). If wildcards is non-nil, thenfind-file-noselect expands wildcard characters in fi lename and visits all thematching fi les.This function displays warning or advisory messages in various peculiar cases, unlessthe optional argument nowarn is non-nil. For example, if it needs to create a buff er,and there is no fi le named fi lename , it displays the message ‘(New file)’ in the echoarea, and leaves the buff er empty.

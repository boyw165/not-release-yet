[Command] save-some-buffers &optional save-silently-p predThis command saves some modifi ed fi le-visiting buff ers. Normally it asks the userabout each buff er. But if save-silently-p is non-nil, it saves all the fi le-visiting buff erswithout querying the user.The optional pred argument controls which buff ers to ask about (or to save silentlyif save-silently-p is non-nil). If it is nil, that means to ask only about fi le-visitingbuff ers. If it is t, that means also off er to save certain other non-fi le buff ers—those thathave a non-nil buff er-local value of buffer-offer-save (see Section 27.10 [KillingBuff ers], page 533 ). A user who says ‘yes’ to saving a non-fi le buff er is asked to specifythe fi le name to use. The save-buffers-kill-emacs function passes the value t forpred.If pred is neither t nor nil, then it should be a function of no arguments. It willbe called in each buff er to decide whether to off er to save that buff er. If it returnsanon-nil value in a certain buff er, that means do off er to save that buffer.

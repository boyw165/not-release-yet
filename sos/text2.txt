it is by default visited without any code conversions. See Section 33.9.3 [Lisp andCoding Systems], page 718.If visit is non-nil, this function additionally marks the buff er as unmodifi ed and setsup various fi elds in the buff er so that it is visiting the file fi lename : these includethe buff er’s visited fi le name and its last save fi le modtime. This feature is usedbyfind-file-noselect and you probably should not use it yourself.If beg and end are non-nil, they should be integers specifying the portion of the fi leto insert. In this case, visit must be nil. For example,(insert-file-contents filename nil 0 500)inserts the fi rst 500 characters of a fi le.If the argument replace is non-nil, it means to replace the contents of the buff er(actually, just the accessible portion) with the contents of the fi le. This is betterthan simply deleting the buff er contents and inserting the whole fi le, because (1)itpreserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data in the undo list.It is possible to read a special fi le (such as a FIFO or an I/O device) with insert-file-contents, as long as replace and visit are nil.
